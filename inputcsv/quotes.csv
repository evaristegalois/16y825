"The Death of the Author","Roland Barthes","Thus literature (it would be better, henceforth, to say writing), by refusing to assign to the text (and to the world as text) a 'secret': that is, an ultimate meaning, liberates an activity which we might call counter-theological, properly revolutionary, for to refuse to arrest meaning is finally to refuse God and his hypostases, reason, science, the law."
"Identity","Judith Butler","What is the peculiar alliance presumed to exist between a system of compulsory heterosexuality and the discursive categories that establish the identity concepts of sex? If 'identity' is an effect of discursive practices, to what extent is gender identity, construed as a relationship among sex, gender, sexual practice, and desire, the effect of a regulatory practice that can be identified as compulsory heterosexuality?"
"What Is Human Agency?","Charles Taylor","A subject who only evaluates weakly---that is, makes decisions like that of eating now or later, taking a holiday in the north or in the south---such a subject we might call a simple weigher of alternatives. And the other, who deploys a language of evaluative contrasts ranging over desires, we might call a strong evaluator ... the strong evaluator envisages his alternatives through a richer language. The desirable is not only defined for him by what he desires, or what he desires plus a calculation of consequences; it is also defined by a qualitative characterization of desires as higher and lower, noble and base, and so on. Reflection is not just a matter, where it is not calculation of consequences, of registering the conclusion that alternative A is more attractive to me, or draws me more than B."
"Two Rival Critiques of Metaphysics","Chris Thornhill","Like Habermas, therefore, Luhmann argued that modern society is necessarily a post-metaphysical society, in which freedoms are founded in wholly autonomous, positivized and consistently rationalized accounts of legal and political necessity."
"Interaction and Transaction","John Dewey and Arthur Bentley","Self-Action: where things are viewed as acting under their own powers. Inter-Action: where thing is balanced against thing in causal interconnection. Trans-Action: where systems of description and naming are employed to deal with aspects and phases of action, without final attribution to elements or other presumptively detachable or independent entities, essences, or realities, and without isolation of presumptively detachable relations from such detachable elements."
"Underground","Fyodor Dostoyevsky","In consequence again of those accursed laws of consciousness, anger in me is subject to chemical disintegration. You look into it, the object flies off into air, your reasons evaporate, the criminal is not to be found, the wrong becomes not a wrong but a phantom, something like the toothache, for which no one is to blame, and consequently there is only the same outlet left again---that is, to beat the wall as hard as you can. So you give it up with a wave of the hand because you have not found a fundamental cause. And try letting yourself be carried away by your feelings, blindly, without reflection, without a primary cause, repelling consciousness at least for a time; hate or love, if only not to sit with your hands folded. The day after tomorrow, at the latest, you will begin despising yourself for having knowingly deceived yourself."
"The Rise of English","Terry Eagleton","Since literature, as we know, deals in universal human values rather than in such historical trivia as civil wars, the oppression of women or the dispossession of the English peasantry, it could serve to place in cosmic perspective the petty demands of working people for decent living conditions or greater control over their own lives, and might even with luck come to render them oblivious of such issues in their high-minded contemplation of eternal truths and beauties."
"Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading","Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick","The monopolistic program of paranoid knowing systematically disallows any explicit recourse to reparative motives, no sooner to be articulated than subject to methodical uprooting. Reparative motives, once they become explicit, are inadmissable within paranoid theory both because they are about pleasure (merely aesthetic) and because they are frankly ameliorative (merely reformist)."
"Against Narrativity","Galen Strawson","I need to say more about the Episodic life, and since I find myself to be relatively Episodic, I'll use myself as an example. I have a past, like any human being, and I know perfectly well that I have a past. I have a respectable amount of factual knowledge about it, and I also remember some of my past experiences 'from the inside,' as philosophers say. And yet I have absolutely no sense of my life as a narrative with form, or indeed as a narrative without form. Absolutely none. Nor do I have any great or special interest in my past. Nor do I have a great deal of concern for my future."
"On Ideology and Interpretation","Robert Holub","Habermas's more serious objections concern the implications of Gadamer's work for an emancipatory political practice. At the centre of his critique are Gadamer's anti-Enlightenment polemics on prejudice, authority and tradition. At issue in particular is the role of authority. For Gadamer authority, as we have seen, is not necessarily authoritarian; true authority does not survive because of blind obedience to a superior force, but because of insight into superior knowledge. Habermas points out that such a view reveals a basic philosophical conviction that is not covered by hermeneutics."
"Existentialism Is a Humanism","Jean-Paul Sartre","He discovers forthwith, that he is without excuse. For if indeed existence precedes essence, one will never be able to explain one's action by reference to a given and specific human nature; in other words, there is no determinism---man is free, man is freedom. Nor, on the other hand, if God does not exist, are we provided with any values or commands that could legitimize our behaviour. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free."
"Faith Seeking Textual Understanding","Kevin Vanhoozer","The moral of Kierkegaard's parables is that readers have ceased to take the privilege and responsibility of interpretation seriously. The purpose of interpretation is no longer to recover and relate to a message from one who is other than ourselves, but precisely to evade such a confrontation. The business of interpretation is busyness: constantly to produce readings in order to avoid having to respond to the text. What is the purpose of such interpretation? Kierkegaard's answer is cynical yet insightful: Look more closely, and you will see that it is to defend itself against God's Word. In order to avoid seeing themselves in Scripture as they really are, some readers prefer either to look at the mirror or to project their own, more flattering, images."
"Carnap's Rational Reconstruction","Penelope Maddy","Setting this puzzle aside, Carnap's logic of science would seem to rest on more firmly scientific ground than Kant's transcendental analysis, because the methods Carnap employs at his higher level are explicitly drawn from among those of ordinary science: the tools of modern mathematical logic. The catch---what loses the Second Philosopher---is that he applies those ordinary scientific methods in the service of a peculiarly philosophical project that from her perspective has no discernible point."
"The Incitement to Discourse","Michel Foucault","Sex was driven out of hiding and constrained to lead a discursive existence. From the singular imperialism that compels everyone to transform their sexuality into a perpetual discourse, to the manifold mechanisms which, in the areas of economy, pedagogy, medicine, and justice, incite, extract, distribute, and institutionalize the sexual discourse, an immense verbosity is what our civilization has required and organized. We talk about sex more than anything else. We have never said enough on the subject, speaking of it ad infinitum, while exploiting it as the secret."
"The Narrative Self-Constitution View","Marya Schechtman","The articulation constraint: having an autobiographical narrative does not involve actually articulating the story of one's life to oneself or to anyone else, but only organizing experience according to an implicit narrative. Nonetheless, the narrative self-constitution view does not allow a person's self-narrative to remain entirely subterranean. A further requirement is that an identity-constituting narrative is capable of local articulation. This means that the narrator should be able to explain why he does what he does, believes what he believes, and feels what he feels."
"In Defense of the Accidental/In Praise of Polytheism","Odo Marquard","Mythonudism strives for something impossible; I have doubts about the striptease: doubts (to put it more precisely) about the idea of the Enlightenment (late in world history) as a striptease operating with myths. Here, the mythical zero wardrobe is itself the explicitly proclaimed goal, and the scientific and emancipatory avant-garde strives for mythical nudity until an impertinent phenomenological hermeneuticist cries out, You there, the gentleman from the late Vienna Circle, you are still wearing myths!"
"The Logic of Scientific Discovery","Karl Popper","These considerations suggest that not the verifiability but the falsifiability of a system is to be taken as a criterion of demarcation. In other words: I shall not require of a scientific system that it shall be capable of being singled out, once and for all, in a positive sense; but I shall require that its logical form shall be such that it can be singled out, by means of empirical tests, in a negative sense: it must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience."
"Sex and Talk","Candace Vogler","The problem of epistemic overkill in bad marriage isn't just the problem of knowing each other too well. It is also the problem of being too much in the grip of an artificially solid sense of one's self (and its history and interests) and too attached to one's view of one's spouse's (equally solid, equally trackable) self."
